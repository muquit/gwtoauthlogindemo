* Use base scribe-java-1.3.6.
* Use extended Google2 API. Taken from: https://gist.github.com/2465453.git
* Extended Instagram2, Linkedin2 Apis
* Extended Facebook API to add "state"
* Generate java class file with OAuth parameters from yaml files. I test
locally and at Google App Engine (GAE). When I think everything is working,
generate the parameters for GAE production and push and I'm done.  It is 
so much easier to maintain three registered apps and test at wil.
* I do not check-in local.yaml, If you need to test locally, just create
local.yaml like gae_*.yaml with your registered fictitious domain and run
the appropricate ant task.
* foursquare requires a version option in protected resource url.
