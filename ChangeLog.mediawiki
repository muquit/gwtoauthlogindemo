* Use gwt 2.6.1
* Use base scribe-java-1.3.6.
* Use extended Google2 API. Taken from: https://gist.github.com/2465453.git
* Extended Instagram2, Linkedin2 APIs
* Extended Facebook API to add "state"
* Generate java class file with OAuth parameters from yaml files. I test locally and at Google App Engine (GAE). When I think everything is working, generate the parameters for GAE production and push and I'm done.  It is so much easier to maintain three registered apps and test at wil.
* I do not check-in yaml files with my registered keys and secrets, If you need to test locally, look at the comments in private/template.yaml
* foursquare requires a version option in protected resource url.
