GWTOAuthLoginDemo]] is a web application written using 
[[https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/|GWT]] to demonstrate user
Authorization using 
[[http://oauth.net/|OAuth]] protocol used by third party providers (Facebook, 
Google, Twitter etc.). This Application uses Server side flow of OAuth
using the 
[[https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java|Scribe]] library. The API is
extended for some providers e.g. Google 2.0, Instagram, github.

* If you need to add third party login in your GWT application, I would like to
think you can use this application as an example. I am releasing the code with
the hope that you will find it useful. I am also interested in code review, 
finding security issues etc. if there are any.

I am in the process of moving the project from [[https://code.google.com/p/gwtoauthlogindemo/]]
