== What is it? ==

* [https://gwtoauthlogindemo-latest.appspot.com/ GWTOAuthLoginDemo] is a web application written using [http://www.gwtproject.org/ GWT] to demonstrate user Authorization using [http://oauth.net/ OAuth] protocol used by third party providers (Facebook, Google, Twitter etc.). This Application uses Server side flow of OAuth using the [https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java Scribe] library. The API is extended for some providers e.g. Google 2.0, Instagram, github.

* If you need to add third party login in your GWT application, I would like to think you can use this application as an example. I am releasing the code with the hope that you will find it useful. I am also interested in code review, finding security issues etc. if there are any.

I am in the process of moving the project from https://code.google.com/p/gwtoauthlogindemo/

== Demo ==
The app is available at Google App Engine:

* Latest version: https://gwtoauthlogindemo-latest.appspot.com/
* Development version: https://gwtoauthlogindemo-test.appspot.com/

== Source ==
Please down the latest source code from [https://github.com/muquit/gwtoauthlogindemo/releases releases].

== Why Prefer Server Side flow of OAuth? ==
* More control. All the logic and processing are done in server side.
* Secure. The request can be signed with your App Secret.
* No JavaScript, no popup window, no logic in client side.
* OAuth artifacts (e.g. Access Token) can remain in the server side. Note: In this example, I bring them to client side explicitly via RPC to show them to you as an example.

== Supported Providers ==
Currently the supported OAuth Providers are:
* Facebook https://developers.facebook.com/
* Google https://console.developers.google.com/
* Twitter https://dev.twitter.com/
* Yahoo! https://developer.yahoo.com/oauth/
* Linkedin https://developer.linkedin.com/
* Instagram http://instagram.com/developer/
* Vimeo https://developer.vimeo.com/
* github https://developer.github.com/
* flickr https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/
* Microsoft Live Connect https://account.live.com/developers/applications/
* tumblr http://www.tumblr.com/developers/
* foursquare https://developer.foursquare.com/

This application uses [https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java scribe-java] in Server Side. The library is very easy to use and extend. Please look at '''server/OAuth/''' directory for extended code for various providers.
